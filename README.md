# QuicksortLab
In this lab, you will implement Quick Sort and Randomized Quicksort algorithm for the same inputs.

For each algorithm, and for each n = 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 4000, 10000, measure its running time and number of steps when the input is (1) already sort, i.e. n, n-1, …, 3, 2,1; (2) reversely sorted 1, 2, 3, … n; (3) random permutation of 1, 2, …, n; (4) 50 instances of n random numbers generated in the range of [1..n].

# Note:

(1) You may have to repeat the algorithm many times, each time you need to initialize the array.

(2) Your running time should exclude the time for initialization. 

(3) All measurement should be done in a single run, i.e. you do not need to run once for n=100, another time for n=200, etc
